                    Fires are driven by many different factors such as weather conditions, topographic 
                    features, and fuels. In the case of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska, vegetation 
                    change is a very influential factor. To determine the relative risk of fire on 
                    the peninsula, This NASA Applied sciences study incorporated some of these 
                    factors into a machine-learning algorithm that learns from previous fire 
                    events and predicts the probability of future fires.

                    The effects of the recent Haitian earthquakes have re-focused research interest 
                    in the complex geological settings of Hispaniola. Previous studies delineate 
                    segments of landslides and liquefaction present in the area, but 
                    current information about the Northeastern Septentrional fault is not 
                    complete. Within that context, a case is presented where the use of 
                    remote sensing techniques such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), band 
                    rationing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and color composite analysis 
                    of Landsat images can assist to map lineaments, mineral distribution, and 
                    help identify fractures and faults in the area. The allocation of lithographic, 
                    structural and mineralogical distribution is attempted by combining remote 
                    sensing results with in-situ structural and chemical analysis.

                    How do we supply a world of unlimited wants with a planet of limited resources? 
                    Today, humans consume in nine months what the Earth produces in a year. Modern techno-scientific
                    developments aid the inherent imperatives of economic systems where developed countries 
                    currently have an ecological footprint five times greater than developing nations. 
                    Nonetheless, as emerging economies join the consuming class, these patterns of consumption 
                    will continue to grow. What is the solution then? Perhaps the underlying solution to ecological
                    degradation and climate change is less a pragmatic and a more philosophical one. It encompasses 
                    a deep examination of humanity’s values and direction as a species living on this planet.
